            1. Semantic elements: These elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way,
            helping both developers and search engines understand the structure of the content. Examples include:
            header: Defines a header section.

            While th is typically used in the thead section to define header cells,
            it can also be employed in the body to indicate that certain cells should be treated as headers for their
            respective rows or columns.
            This can enhance accessibility and provide additional context for the data presented in the table. However,
            it's important to ensure that the usage of th in the tbody is meaningful and maintains the overall structure
            of the table.</p>

        <summary>26.What is git vs github?</summary>
        <p>Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in source code over time, manage
            collaborative projects,
            and maintain different versions of files efficiently. It enables users to create repositories, commit
            changes, and branch off code,
            facilitating collaboration among multiple contributors.

            GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides additional
            features for project management,
            collaboration, and social coding. It offers a user-friendly interface for hosting Git repositories, sharing
            code, tracking issues,
            and facilitating pull requests, making it a popular choice for developers and open-source projects.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
        <summary>27.What is the workflow of github?</summary>
        <p>The workflow of GitHub typically involves several key steps that facilitate collaboration and version control
            in software development. Here’s a simplified overview:

            1. Create a Repository: Start by creating a new repository on GitHub to store your project. This repository
            contains all the files, commit history, and branches associated with the project.

            2. Stage Changes: Use the `git add` command to stage the modified files, preparing them for a commit.
            Staging allows you to choose which changes to include in the next commit.

            3. Commit Changes: Use the `git commit` command to save your staged changes to the local repository,
            including a meaningful commit message that describes the changes made.

            4. Push Changes: Use the `git push` command to upload your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub,
            making your changes visible to others.

            5. Create a Pull Request: If collaborating with others, you can create a pull request on GitHub to propose
            your changes for review. This allows team members to discuss, review, and suggest modifications before
            merging.

            6. Pull Updates: Regularly use the `git pull` command to fetch and integrate changes from the remote
            repository into your local copy, ensuring that you stay up-to-date with the latest developments.

            This workflow allows teams to collaborate effectively, maintain a clean project history, and ensure code
            quality through reviews and testing.</p>

        <summary>39.Can we use block elements in inline elements?
        </summary>
        <p>No, it is not recommended to use block elements inside inline elements in HTML, as it can lead to
            unpredictable behavior and invalid markup. Block elements are designed to create a new block of content,
            while inline elements are meant to be part of a line of text without breaking the flow.

            When you place block elements inside inline elements, browsers may still render the content, but it could
            result in unexpected layout issues.
            To maintain proper structure and semantics, it's best to use block elements for larger content sections and
            inline elements for text-level formatting within those sections.</p>
